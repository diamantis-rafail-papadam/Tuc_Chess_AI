# Technical University of Crete - PLH311 - Project
This is an assignment I completed as an undergraduate student in a team of 2 members.

To execute open 3 terminals and run:
	1) java -jar tuc-chess-server.jar.jar (1st terminal is the server)
	2) java -jar <Player_Name>.jar        (2nd terminal is the white player)
	3) java -jar <Player_Name>.jar        (3rd terminal is the black players)
	
Available agents are:
	Alemantis.jar        (The agent my team created)
	tuc-chess-client.jar (Default Agent)
	
Of course you can always create your own agent by changing the source code and run it against our agent.
Have fun :)
